BUILD OUTPUT DESCRIPTION
========================


1.) Install Java on your computer if it isn't installed. 

You can't run JAR files without Java installed on your computer. If you don't already have Java installed, go to Java's website at https://www.java.com/en/download/ and click the Free Java Download button below the latest version of Java, then install Java once it downloads.
You may have to restart your computer for Java to be fully implemented.

2.) Now Click "G-Share.jar" 

Notes:

*JAR stands for Java ARchive. 
It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and is used for aggregating many files into one.

*Although JAR can be used as a general archiving tool, the primary motivation for its development was so that Java applets and their requisite components (.class files, images and sounds) can be downloaded to a browser in a single HTTP transaction, rather than opening a new connection for each piece. 
This greatly improves the speed with which an applet can be loaded onto a web page and begin functioning. The JAR format also supports compression, which reduces the size of the file and improves download time still further.

*On Microsoft Windows systems, the Java 2 Runtime Environment's installation program will register a default association for JAR files so that double-clicking a JAR file on the desktop will automatically run it with javaw -jar. Dependent extensions bundled with the application will also be loaded automatically. This feature makes the end-user runtime environment easier to use on Microsoft Windows systems.
